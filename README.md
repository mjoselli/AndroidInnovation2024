### Project: Bluetooth-Controlled Robot Android Application

#### Overview

In this project, you will develop an Android application that interfaces with a robot via Bluetooth. The application will send control commands to the robot, such as moving forward, backward, turning left, and turning right. This project aims to apply practical Android development skills with Bluetooth communication to control hardware devices.

#### Project Deliverables

1. **Android Application (Source Code):** A fully functional Android application project, submitted as a ZIP file. The application should be developed using Java in Android Studio.

2. **Project Report (PDF Format):** A comprehensive report detailing the project, including the following sections:
   - **Name of the Students:** List all group members who contributed to the project.
   - **Introduction:** A brief overview of the project, including its background and the motivation behind creating a Bluetooth-controlled robot application.
   - **Objectives:** Clearly state what the project aims to achieve, including learning objectives and any specific functionalities you intend to implement in the application.
   - **Screens of the Application:** Provide screenshots of the actual application screens. These should demonstrate the application in use, showcasing its design and functionality.
   - **Components Used:** Detail the Android components and Bluetooth APIs used in the project. Explain how these components interact within the application to facilitate Bluetooth communication with the robot.

#### Project Specifications

1. **Android Studio Version:** Use Android Studio for the development to ensure compatibility with the project guidelines.

2. **Language:** The application must be written in Java/Kotlin.

3. **UI Design:** Utilize the interface builder for designing the application's interfaces. The design should be user-friendly and intuitive, facilitating easy control of the robot.

4. **Bluetooth Communication:** Implement Bluetooth capabilities to discover, pair, and communicate with the robot. Your application should handle permissions, enable Bluetooth if it's not already on, and list available Bluetooth devices for connection.

5. **Control Interface:** Develop a simple control interface with buttons to send commands to the robot (e.g., forward, backward, left, right).

6. **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling for Bluetooth communication to deal with scenarios like unsuccessful connections or transmission errors.

#### Evaluation Criteria

- **Functionality:** The application must meet all functional requirements, including successful Bluetooth pairing and command transmission to the robot.
- **User Interface Design:** The UI should be intuitive, responsive, and visually appealing.
- **Code Quality:** The source code should be well-organized, properly commented, and adhere to best practices in Java development.
- **Report Quality:** The report must be well-written, covering all required sections. It should provide a clear understanding of the project, its objectives, and its outcomes.

#### Submission Guidelines

- Submit the zipped source code of the Android application and the project report in PDF format.
- Ensure the ZIP file contains the complete Android Studio project folder.
- Name the ZIP file and PDF report according to the following convention: `GroupName_BluetoothRobotController.zip` and `GroupName_ProjectReport.pdf`.
- Groups of 2/3
- Deadline: 24/03/2024.

This project combines software development skills with practical applications in robotics and Bluetooth communication. It offers an opportunity to learn about Android programming, user interface design, and wireless communication protocols. Good luck!
